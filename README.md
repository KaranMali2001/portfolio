## 🧠 Development Philosophy

### 80% Thinking, 20% Coding

I believe backend development is fundamentally about problem-solving. Before writing a single line of code, I spend time understanding the problem from first principles. This approach has helped me build systems that not only work but scale efficiently and remain maintainable as requirements evolve.

### My Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem** - Break down complex requirements into fundamental components
2. **Design for Scale** - Consider how the system will behave with 10x, 100x more load
3. **Implement Simply** - Choose the simplest solution that meets all requirements

## 📝 Blog & Writing

I regularly share insights about backend development, system design, and engineering best practices on Medium:
